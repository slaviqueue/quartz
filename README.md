# quartz
flexing my language-writing muscles

### Issues so far

#### - No explicit return statement

Not sure if it will be introduced since everything is an expression and in js "return" is a statement

#### - Reserved js keywords cannot be used as identifiers

For example despite there's no such keyword as "const" in quartz, using it as an identifier will lead to a runtime error
